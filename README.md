# Engine
A 2D game engine I made in 2020 to 2021 for fun and from scratch using NodeJS, HTML and CSS.

## Running the Engine
To run the engine you must port forward and have NodeJS. You can port forward any port because you can change it in the Global/path.js file AND in the main.js file, but the default port provided, that you can port forward is 1337 if you do not want to change it to something else.

Once you port forwarded 1337 or a custom port, you have to edit the Global/path.js file to include your computers IPv4 Address in the 000.000.0.0 space and the port you forwarded in the 1337 space and in main.js.

When those edited files are saved to run the eingine open command prompt in the folder containing main.js and type: 'node main.js' If everything is done correctly you can copy the path in the Global/path.js file and place it into your search bar to open the engine. 

Example: http://123.123.1.1:1337/index.html <-- need the index.html
