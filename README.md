# Engine
A 2D game engine I made in 2020 to 2021 for fun and from scratch using JavaScript, NodeJS, HTML and CSS.

## Running the Engine
To run the engine you must edit the Global/path.js file to include "http://localhost:YOUR_PORT" in the 000.000.0.0 space and YOUR_PORT can be found in main.js, there will be a const variable defined as PORT, set it to whatever port you want to use and make sure to include it in the full path of Global/path.js.

When those edited files are saved, you can run the engine by opening command prompt in the folder containing main.js and typing: 'node main.js' If everything is done correctly you can copy the path in the Global/path.js file and place it into your search bar to open the engine. 

Example: http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/index.html <-- need the index.html
